<p>This 2D Roguelike Game was made for Williams College Winter Study 2016. It served as first exploration into the process and challenges of creating and customizing a game engine. Currently I am working to port the code into Unity. </p>

<p>Daedalus Adrift is set to take place on the starship Daedalus in the far future. In this future the dominant civilization is the Earth based human empire which has conquered all encountered sentient life. The ship itself is carrying precious cargo for the empire: A dangerous assortment of creatures captured from across the galaxy destined for display in zoos and museums. You play as a maintence worker, a slave from one of the various races dominated by the humans. In order to escape the ship, you must find ways to release the ships hostile creatures and harness their strengths, in spite of their attempts to consume you. </p>
